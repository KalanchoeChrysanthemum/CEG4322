# CEG4322 - Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit Design

This repository serves as an archive for the project my teammates and I constructed for VLSI.

Our project was an 8-bit CPU, constructed in 45nm CMOS technology (as taught in the course).

The CPU consisted of three main components:
- Control Unit: Partitioned and sequenced data/operations
- Data Unit: Handled mathematical functions
- RAM: Memory


Teammates:
- *Jeremiah Carter*
- *Logan Current*
